# UNIX shell scripting: course prerequisites

The **UNIX Shell Scripting** course is an intermediate course that assumes
participants to **be familiar with the basics of the bash shell**, such as
covered for instance in the SIB
[Introduction to Linux / UNIX and the Bash shell](https://github.com/sib-swiss/unix-first-steps-training)
course.

To help you evaluate whether the advanced course is for you, this document
lists the notions with which you should be familiar: if any of the following
seems mysterious, you may consider taking more introductory course before
this one.

## Shells in General

* What is a shell.
* How to launch a shell on your machine.
* How one works in the shell, especially as compared with working in a
  graphical environment.

## Commands

* How to execute shell commands.
* How shells communicate results (if any).
* What arguments are and how to pass them.
* What options are and how to pass them.

## The filesystem

* How files and directories are organized.
* What the current directory is and how to determine it.
* The difference between an absolute and a relative pathname.
* How to list files in the current directory (and, for that matter, in any
  directory).
* How to move around the filesystem.
* How to rename and move files.

## Text files

* What a text file is, how it differs from, say, a Word document, and how this
  relates to shell commands.

## Redirection and pipelines

* How to redirect commands' input and output to/from files.
* How to pass the output of one command to another command's input.
* What a pipeline is.

## Basic UNIX commands

You should know the purpose of the following tools, and be able to understand
what they do (though in-depth knowledge is not required):

* `cut`
* `find`
* `grep`
* `head`
* `man`
* `sort`
* `tail`
* `tr`
* `wc`

## Text Editor

We will be writing code, so you need to be comfortable with using a text
editor/IDE.
